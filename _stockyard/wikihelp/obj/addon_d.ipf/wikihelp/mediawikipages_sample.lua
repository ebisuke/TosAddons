'''Oracles''' are clerics who possess foresight. They can predict or interfere with an enemy's attacks and determine their fate.

==Lore==
'''Oracles''' are spokespersons for the Goddess, who answer the questions people may have for the Goddess. The Goddess' do not interfere in the free will of men so most prophecies are told through symbols and metaphors. Even now, when the Goddess' are out of reach, '''Oracles''' can still deliver prophecies from the Goddess because the Goddess' will provide limitless wisdom despite being disconnected from the world.
